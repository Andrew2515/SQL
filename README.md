## üìñ Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Higher Diploma in Science in Software Development** to demonstrate key concepts in **database design, normalization, and SQL query development**.  
It includes both **schema design files** (`.mwb`) and **SQL scripts** (`.sql`) that create, populate, and query a sample relational database.
